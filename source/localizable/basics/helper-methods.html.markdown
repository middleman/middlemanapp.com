# Helper Methods

Template helpers are methods which can be used in your dynamic templates to
simplify common HTML tasks. Most of the basic methods should be very familiar
to anyone who has used Rails view helpers. These helpers are all built on the
Padrino Framework, [view the full documentation here].

## Link Helpers

Padrino provides a `link_to` function that you can use to make link tags. At
its most basic, `link_to` takes the name and URL of a link:

```erb
<%= link_to 'My Site', 'http://mysite.com' %>
```

`link_to` can also take a block, allowing you to provide more complex content for the link:

```erb
<% link_to 'http://mysite.com' do %>
  <%= image_tag 'mylogo.png' %>
<% end %>
```

Middleman enhances the `link_to` helper to be aware of the
[sitemap](/advanced/sitemap/). If you refer to pages in your source folder
(with their file extension minus all the template extensions) then `link_to`
will generate the correct link, even if you have extensions like
[`:directory_indexes`](/advanced/pretty-urls/) on. For example, if you had a file
`source/about.html` and `:directory_indexes` on, you could link to it like
this:

```erb
<%= link_to 'About', '/about.html' %>
```

Produces:

```html
<a href='/about/'>About</a>
```

You can also refer to source paths relative to your current page. Some people
want their links to be relative to the current page. Pass `:relative => true`
to `link_to` to get a relative URL.

From within source/foo/index.html.erb, with `:directory_indexes` on:

```erb
<%= link_to 'About', '/about.html', :relative => true %>
```

Produces:

```html
<a href="../about/">About</a>
```

If you want all URLs generated by `link_to` to be relative, add this to `config.rb`:

```ruby
set :relative_links, true
```

You can still override individual links to not be relative by adding `:relative
=> false`.

If the `link_to` helper fails to determine which page the URL provided belongs
to, it will use the URL without modifying it. The `:relative_links` option will
be ignored in this case, but the `:relative => true` argument will produce an
error.

Note that the [`url` method] of the [Sitemap](/advanced/sitemap/) Resource
(also inherited by [Blogging](/basics/blogging/) BlogArticle) returns an
*output URL*. The `link_to` helper may be unable to match it to a *source path*
of the corresponding page/article and thus will be unable to convert it to a
relative URL.

Instead of providing the output url for `link_to`, provide either the *source
path* via Resource/BlogArticle [`path` attribute] or simply pass the resource
itself as the URL argument for `link_to`. Both will have `link_to` produce
relative URLs:

```erb
<ul>
  <% blog.articles.each do |article| %>
    <li>
      <%= link_to article.title, article.path, :relative => true %>
      <%# Note `article.path` in the second argument %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<ul>
  <% sitemap.resources.select{|resource| resource.data.title}.each do |resource| %>
    <li>
      <%= link_to resource.data.title, resource, :relative => true %>
      <%# Note `resource` in the second argument %>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

You can include query parameters or URL fragments in your links as well:

```erb
<%= link_to 'My Form', '/form.html', :query => { :foo => 'bar' }, :fragment => 'deep' %>
```

Produces:

```html
<a href='/form.html?foo=bar#deep'>My Form</a>
```

If you just want the URL to a page without the link tag, use `url_for`. It
powers all the magic in `link_to`, and is used in `form_tag` as well.

## Output Helpers

Output helpers are a collection of important methods for managing, capturing
and displaying output in various ways and is used frequently to support
higher-level helper functions. There are three output helpers worth mentioning:
`content_for`, `capture_html`, and `concat_content`.

The `content_for` functionality supports capturing content and then rendering
this into a different place such as within a layout. One such example is
including assets onto the layout from a template:

```erb
<% content_for :assets do %>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'index', 'custom' %>
<% end %>
```

Added to a template, this will capture the includes from the block and allow
them to be yielded into the layout:

```erb
<head>
  <title>Example</title>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'style' %>
  <%= yield_content :assets %>
</head>
```

This will automatically insert the contents of the block (in this case a
stylesheet include) into the location the content is yielded within the layout.

You can also check if a `content_for` block exists for a given key using
`content_for?`:

```erb
<% if content_for?(:assets) %>
  <div><%= yield_content :assets %></div>
<% end %>
```

Also supports arguments yielded to the content block

```erb
yield_content :head, param1, param2
content_for(:head) { |param1, param2| ...content... }
```

## Tag Helpers

Tag helpers are the basic building blocks used to construct html "tags" within
a view template. There are three major functions for this category: `tag`,
`content_tag` and `input_tag`.

The `tag` and `content_tag` are for building arbitrary html tags with a name
and specified options. If the tag contains "content" within then `content_tag`
is used. For example:

```erb
<%= tag :img, :src => "/my_image.png" %>
  # => <img src='/my_image.png'>

<% content_tag :p, :class => "stuff" do %>
  Hello
<% end %>
  # => <p class='stuff'>Hello</p>
```

The input_tag is used to build tags that are related to accepting input from
the user:

```erb
input_tag :text, :class => "demo"
  # => <input type='text' class='demo'>
input_tag :password, :value => "secret", :class => "demo"
  # => <input type='password' value='secret' class='demo'>
```

## Asset Helpers

Asset helpers are intended to help insert useful html onto a view template such
as hyperlinks, `mail_to` links, images, stylesheets and JavaScript. An example of
their uses would be on a simple view template:

```erb
<html>
<head>
  <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'layout' %>
  <%= javascript_include_tag 'application' %>
  <%= favicon_tag 'images/favicon.png' %>
</head>
<body>
  <p><%= link_to 'Blog', '/blog', :class => 'example' %></p>
  <p>Mail me at <%= mail_to 'fake@faker.com', "Fake Email Link", :cc => "test@demo.com" %></p>
  <p><%= image_tag 'padrino.png', :width => '35', :class => 'logo' %></p>
</body>
</html>
```

You can use `auto_stylesheet_link_tag` and `auto_javascript_include_tag` to
generate stylesheet and JavaScript includes based on the current path. So if
your page is `contact.html`, you'll get `contact.css` and `contact.js`.

## Form Helpers

Form helpers are the "standard" form tag helpers you would come to expect when
building forms. A simple example of constructing a non-object form would be:

```erb
<% form_tag '/destroy', :class => 'destroy-form', :method => 'delete' do %>
  <% field_set_tag do %>
    <p>
      <%= label_tag :username, :class => 'first' %>
      <%= text_field_tag :username, :value => params[:username] %>
    </p>
    <p>
      <%= label_tag :password, :class => 'first' %>
      <%= password_field_tag :password, :value => params[:password] %>
    </p>
    <p>
      <%= label_tag :strategy %>
      <%= select_tag :strategy, :options => ['delete', 'destroy'],
          :selected => 'delete' %>
    </p>
    <p>
      <%= check_box_tag :confirm_delete %>
    </p>
  <% end %>
  <% field_set_tag(:class => 'buttons') do %>
    <%= submit_tag "Remove" %>
  <% end %>
<% end %>
```

## Format Helpers

Format helpers are several useful utilities for manipulating the format of text
to achieve a goal.  The four format helpers are `escape_html`,
`distance_of_time_in_words`, `time_ago_in_words`, and `js_escape_html`.

The `escape_html` and `js_escape_html` function are for taking an html string
and escaping certain characters.  `escape_html` will escape ampersands,
brackets and quotes to their HTML/XML entities. This is useful to sanitize user
content before displaying this on a template. `js_escape_html` is used for
passing JavaScript information from a JS template to a JavaScript function.

```erb
escape_html('<hello>&<goodbye>') # => &lt;hello&gt;&amp;&lt;goodbye&gt;
```

There is also an alias for `escape_html` called `h` for even easier usage
within templates.

Format helpers also includes a number of useful text manipulation functions
such as `simple_format`, `pluralize`, `word_wrap`, and `truncate`.

```erb
simple_format("hello\nworld")
  # => "<p>hello<br/>world</p>"
pluralize(2, 'person')
  # => '2 people'
word_wrap('Once upon a time', :line_width => 8)
  # => "Once upon\na time"
truncate("Once upon a time in a world far far away", :length => 8)
  # => "Once upon..."
truncate_words("Once upon a time in a world far far away", :length => 4)
  # => "Once upon a time..."
highlight('Lorem dolor sit', 'dolor')
  # => "Lorem <strong class="highlight">dolor</strong> sit"
```

## Lorem Ipsum & Placehold.it helpers

The [Frank project], a static tool also inspired by Sinatra, has a wonderful
set of helpers for generating random text content and placeholder images. We've
adapted this code for Middleman (god bless the MIT license).

For example, if you want to insert 5 sentences of lorem ipsum, you would write

```erb
<%= lorem.sentences 5 %>
```

Other methods available to be used for text:

```ruby
lorem.sentence      # returns a single sentence
lorem.words 5       # returns 5 individual words
lorem.word
lorem.paragraphs 10 # returns 10 paragraphs
lorem.paragraph
lorem.date          # accepts a strftime format argument
lorem.name
lorem.first_name
lorem.last_name
lorem.email
```

And to use placeholder images:

```ruby
lorem.image('300x400')
  #=> http://placehold.it/300x400
lorem.image('300x400', :background_color => '333', :color => 'fff')
  #=> http://placehold.it/300x400/333/fff
lorem.image('300x400', :random_color => true)
  #=> http://placehold.it/300x400/f47av7/9fbc34d
lorem.image('300x400', :text => 'blah')
  #=> http://placehold.it/300x400&text=blah
```

## Page Classes

It can be useful to generate classes on the `body` tag that correspond to the
site hierarchy. `page_classes` generates those classes. Imagine you have a page
at `projects/rockets/saturn-v.html`, and the following in your layout:

```erb
<body class="<%= page_classes %>">
```

You'll get:

```html
<body class="projects rockets saturn-v">
```

This makes it easy to apply project-specific, or rocket-specific styles to the
page.

## Environment Helpers

Middleman comes with two environment helpers `build?` and `development?`. These
helpers can be used to only include code for certain environments. One common
example is Google Analytics tracking code. If you want to avoid sending events
when trying out your website on localhost, only include it in your production build.

```erb
<% if build? %>
  <%= partial "tracking_snippet" %>
<% end %>
```

## Custom Defined Helpers

In addition to the helpers provided by Middleman out of the box, you can also
add your own helper methods and classes that will be accessible within any
controller or view automatically.

To define a helper method, use the `helpers` block in `config.rb`:

```ruby
helpers do
  def some_method
    # ...do something here...
  end
end
```

Alternatively, you can create external Ruby modules which contain helpers and
include them. You can put files in the `lib` directory. For example, if you
were to extract the above helpers into a file named `lib/custom_helpers.rb`,
you could create a module:

```ruby
module CustomHelpers
  def some_method
    # ...do something here...
  end
end
```

Then in `config.rb`:

```ruby
require "lib/custom_helpers"
helpers CustomHelpers
```

An even easier way is to put your helpers in the `helpers` directory and name
them after their module (i.e., `CustomHelpers` lives in
`helpers/custom_helpers.rb`). Then, Middleman will automatically load them and
register them as helpers.

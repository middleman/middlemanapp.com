# Asset Pipeline

The Rails Asset Pipeline has been removed from the core of Middleman v4. Its
future is in flux. If you heavily rely on this feature, we are looking for
community maintainers to keep it running in v4. Please contact us.

The replacement is the [external_pipeline feature] which is much more robust and
future-proof, at the expense of simplicity and familiarity for Rails developers.

[external_pipeline feature]: /advanced/external-pipeline/

# LiveReload

Middleman provides an official extension to support for the LiveReload browser extension. Simply install the gem:

``` bash
gem install middleman-livereload
```

If you have installed [the LiveReload extension] in your browser, you can have Middleman automatically tell the browser to refresh upon changes to your source code. Now, browsers using the LiveReload extension can connect to Middleman and automatically refresh after you update your code.
